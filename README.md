# Fuzzy logic. Operations on intervals with React.js

This's work for my CS course of `Fuzzy Logic`.
Live demo: http://igorperesunko.com/fuzzy_logic/

All operation on intervals you could find in `components/Main/Range`.
I used Jest as default tool for JavaScript testing.

Project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
